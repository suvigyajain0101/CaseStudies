            " linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. to evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for  osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). pathogens were methicillin-resistantother_species (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistantother_species (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitiveother_species (n = 1). after a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. during week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. during week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. we recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect  hematologic abnormalities. we conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.\n",

            "CLEANED TEXT :  successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin resistant staphylococci and vancomycin resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long term administration to evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long term remission we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for osteomyelitis n 9 or prosthetic joint infection n 2 linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks range 6 to 19 weeks pathogens were methicillin resistantother species n 5 methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci n 4 vancomycin resistantother species n 1 and vancomycin sensitiveother species n 1 after a mean followup of 27 months range 17 to 41 months all 11 patients had remission by clinical laboratory and radiographic criteria during week 8 of linezolid treatment one patient developed a gram negative superinfection which resolved with appropriate therapy during week 6 of linezolid treatment one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6 week courses of linezolid we recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect hematologic abnormalities we conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections\n",

            " AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of pectic oligosaccharides (POS) to inhibit adhesion of three strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli, three strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, and one nonclinical strain of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans to human intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus gasseri were included for comparison. Attachment was determined in the human HT29 cell line by viable count of adherent bacteria. POS in buffer at pH 7.2 were antiadhesive at a dose of 2.5 mg ml(-1), reducing adhesion of enteropathogenic E. coil and verotoxigenic E. coli strains to less than 30% of control values. Concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition ranged from 0.15 to 0.46 mg ml(-1). L. acidophilus was not significantly affected, but adhesion of L. gasseri was reduced to 29% of the control value. POS reduced the adhesion of D. desulfuricans to 0.33% of the control value. POS also had a protective effect against E. coli verocytotoxins VT1 and VT2 at concentrations of 0.01 and 1 microg ml(-1), respectively.\n",

L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
