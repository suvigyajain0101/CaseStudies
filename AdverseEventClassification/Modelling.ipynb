            " patients (n = 409) with severe skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were randomized to receive clinafloxacin or piperacillin-tazobactam (plus optional vancomycin for methicillin-resistant cocci), administered intravenously, with the option to switch to oral medication. most patients had cellulitis, wound infections, or diabetic foot infections.other_species,other_species, andother_species were the most common baseline pathogens. fewer baseline pathogens were resistant to clinafloxacin (1.8%) than to piperacillin-tazobactam (6.2%) (p = 0.001). the clinafloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam groups did not differ significantly in clinical cure rates (68.8 and 65.2%, respectively) or microbiologic eradication rates (61.5 and 57.2%). clinafloxacin yielded higher eradication rates for all three of the most  common pathogenic species, although no differences were statistically significant. within the power of this study, the overall frequency of adverse events was similar (p = 0.577) in the two treatment groups. drug-associated adverse events (p = 0.050) and treatment discontinuations (p = 0.052) were marginally more frequent in the clinafloxacin group, primarily due to phototoxicity in outpatients receiving clinafloxacin. although most cases of phototoxicity were mild to moderate, four cases were reported as severe. in summary, clinafloxacin monotherapy was equivalent in effectiveness to therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam plus optional vancomycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe sstis.\n",

            " background: given the known link between vancomycin-resistantother_species (vref) and vancomycin-resistantother_species (vrsa), the recent increase in prevalence of vref in southeast michigan has raised concerns about the presence of a large \"community\" reservoir of vref. efforts to control its spread face some important challenges. methods: patients with clinical isolates of community-onset (co) vref (cases) were compared with matched uninfected controls (study 1) and patients with hospital-onset (ho) vref (study 2). here, co was defined as a hospital stay of </=2 days before vre isolation. results: independent predictors for the isolation of co-vref compared with uninfected controls were nonhome residence; chronic skin ulcers; previous invasive procedures/surgery; exposure to cephalosporin, penicillin, and/or vancomycin; immunosuppressive status; and the presence of indwelling devices. independent predictors for isolation of co-vref compared with ho-vref included no stay in an  intensive care unit in the previous 3 months and recent hospitalization. vref isolation from wounds and aminoglycoside exposure were inversely associated with  isolation of co-vref. conclusions: health care-related exposures and antimicrobial exposures are risk factors for the isolation of co-vref. regional infection control practices are imperative in controlling co-vref, in addition to the emergence and spread of vrsa.\n",
